/**
 * Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ThrowingBiFunction} distinguishes itself from {@link BiFunction} by allowing the functional interface to throw an
 * {@link Exception}. This can be used to allow lambda expressions to propagate checked exceptions up the expression's call stack.
 * An example of this pattern:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * BiFunction<Integer,Integer,String> function = Throwing.<Integer,Integer,String>rethrow((i, j) -> {
 *   if (i == 0)
 *     throw new IllegalArgumentException("i=" + i);
 *   return String.valueOf(i);
 * });
 * for (int i = 3; i >= 0; --i)
 *   function.accept(i, -i);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the first input to the operation.
 * @param <U> The type of the second input to the operation.
 * @param <R> The type of the result of the function.
 * @param <E> The type of the exception that can be thrown.
 * @see Throwing#rethrow(ThrowingBiFunction)
