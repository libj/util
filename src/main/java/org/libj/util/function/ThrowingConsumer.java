/**
 * Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. Unlike most other functional interfaces,
 * {@link Consumer} is expected to operate via side-effects.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ThrowingConsumer} distinguishes itself from {@link Consumer} by allowing the functional interface to throw an
 * {@link Exception}. This can be used to allow lambda expressions to propagate checked exceptions up the expression's call stack.
 * An example of this pattern:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Arrays.asList(2, 1, 0).forEach(Throwing.rethrow(i -> {
 *   if (i == 0)
 *     throw new IllegalArgumentException("i=" + i);
 * }));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the input to the operation.
 * @param <E> The type of the exception that can be thrown.
 * @see Throwing#rethrow(ThrowingConsumer)
